# ## Write the following code in Python:

# * print your name 5 times

print("Inna " *5)
# * print Bananananana using "Ba" once and "na" 5 times
print("In " + "na"*6)
# * print the number of seconds in a year calculated from months, days, minutes, seconds
print (365*24*60*60)
# * how much a googol is that is 10 to the power of the 100th
print(10 ** 100)
# * how much will your 1000 Euro investment be worth after 12 years of 6% yearly interest?
print(1000*1.06 ** 12)

# rule of 72
# 72 / 6 = 12
# * You can submit a .py file or a link to your code repository on Github.

# Alternatives would be a link to pastebin.com, pastebin.pl or similar code paste tool.

# As a last resort you can submit code through text, but that is not recommended.
