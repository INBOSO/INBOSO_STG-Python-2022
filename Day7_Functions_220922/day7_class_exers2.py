# 2. Palindrome


# Write the function is_palindrome(text)

# which returns a bool True or False depending on whether the word or sentence is read equally from both sides.

# PS You can start with a one-word solution from the beginning, but the full solution will ignore whitespace and uppercase and lowercase letters.


# is_palindrome ("Alus ari i ra    sula") -> True

# is_palindrome("ABa") -> True

# is_palindrome("nava") -> False
# Python has type hints, which are not mandatory but can be used to help the developer
# type hints are like United Nations letters, they are not mandatory but they are useful
